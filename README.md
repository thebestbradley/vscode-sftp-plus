# SFTP+ Sync

Welcome to the SFTP+ Sync repository! This is a fork of the actively maintained [SFTP extension](https://github.com/Natizyskunk/vscode-sftp) by [@Natizyskunk](https://github.com/Natizyskunk) and [@satiromarra](https://github.com/satiromarra). Our goal is to enhance and add new features, while maintaining compatibility with the original project. This will give access to our added features to the end users independently and quicker. We will push our improvements back to the original repo when they are ready and beneficial to the broader community. [wiki](https://github.com/thebestbradley/vscode-sftp-plus/wiki)

## Quick Configuration

If the latest files are already on a remote server, you can start with an empty local folder, then download your project, and from that point sync.

1. In `VS Code`, open a local directory you wish to sync to the remote server (or create an empty directory that you wish to first download the contents of a remote server folder in order to edit locally).
2. `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac open command palette, run `SFTP: config` command.
3. A basic configuration file will appear named `sftp.json` under the `.vscode` directory, open and edit the configuration parameters with your remote server information.

For instance:
```json
{
    "name": "Profile Name",
    "host": "name_of_remote_host",
    "protocol": "ftp",
    "port": 21,
    "secure": true,
    "username": "username",
    "remotePath": "/public_html/project", // <--- This is the path which will be downloaded if you "Download Project"
    "password": "password",
    "uploadOnSave": false
}
```
The password parameter in `sftp.json` is optional, if left out you will be prompted for a password on sync.
_Note：_ backslashes and other special characters must be escaped with a backslash.

4. Save and close the `sftp.json` file.
5. `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac open command palette.
6. Type `sftp` and you'll now see a number of other commands. You can also access many of the commands from the project's file explorer context menus.
7. A good one to start with if you want to sync with a remote folder is `SFTP: Download Project`. This will download the directory shown in the `remotePath` setting in `sftp.json` to your local open directory.
8. Done - you can now edit locally and after each save it will upload to sync your remote file with the local copy.
9. Enjoy!
